== Very Simple Multi-Step, Multi-Model Form

This is a very simple demo for submitting data to 2 associated models via a 2 page form.

Two Models: Company and Company Contact.

Company has one Company Contact.
Company Contact belongs to Company.

Cucumber Features prove it works, but it is the simplest happy path. I leave it as
an exercise for the reader to handle edge cases, and error handling.

== Basic Overview

1. User fills out, and submits the Company Form.
2. Data is sent to the create action in CompaniesController.
3. Company Data is stored in a session var - session[:company].
4. CompaniesController redirects to new_company_contact_path.
5. User fills out and submits Company Contact Form.
6. Data is sent to the create action in CompanyContactsController.
7. CompanyContactsController saves the Company Data stored in session[:company].
8. CompanyContactsController saves the CompanyContact Data as submitted by the form.
9. CompanyContactsController redirects to show the Company and CompanyContact data.

== Notes

I don't like erb, so the views are in haml.
